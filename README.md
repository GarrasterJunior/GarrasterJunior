Hi! My name's Garraster JÃºnior
- I'm a beginner dev. I'm looking for experience in programming and my first job as a dev. The biggest project I've ever been a part of, so far, was a college project. Where we made a program that received information from a TCC and saved it. Therefore, edits can be effected in the information and also in the search for the specific TCC.

## Details
- -> I'm a UFC student 
- -> I'm studying about JavaScript and React.js
- ->I work well in a team and am always willing to help.
